Hi, my name is John Carlo Gayoso

I am studying in De La Salle University - Dasmarinas and currently in 4th year taking the course of Computer Science.

I like doing household chores and made it my personal therapy. I also like to do physical activities such as sports. I enjoy spending time with my family. I also enjoy watching and playing video games. Lastly, I like to listen to music because it soothes my emotions.
